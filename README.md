# Tractor-Track Prototype.

- Tracktor-Track is a web app, where tractor-drivers, add, manage their work records, payment dues and payments.

- Here in this prototype, I made it for a single user(tractor-driver) who can add new works( what they did for farmers), then checkout the payment dues, and if payes they collect it and record it as a payment.

- The main motive of this app will be make their work records organiziable, dues at their finger tips, easy to maintain the records of payments as well..
